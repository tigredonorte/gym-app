# GymApp

## Project Overview

This project aims to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for managing and analyzing large datasets. It offers a suite of tools for data ingestion, processing, visualization, and reporting, catering to the needs of data scientists, analysts, and business users.

## Key Features

*   **Feature A:** Description of feature A.
*   **Feature B:** Description of feature B.
*   **Feature C:** Description of feature C.
*   **Advanced Analytics:** Leverages machine learning for predictive insights.
*   **Collaboration Tools:** Enables team members to work together on projects.

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** React, Redux, TypeScript
*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL
*   **DevOps:** Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins
*   **Testing:** Jest, Cypress

## Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
*   pnpm (v8 or higher). Install via `npm install -g pnpm` if you haven't already. Then run `pnpm setup` to configure your shell.
*   Git
*   Docker (for running local database, mail server, etc.)
*   Run `bash ./infra/local/init-repository.sh` to set up required environment variables and local configurations. This script may require `pnpm setup` to have been run first. Ensure the script is executable (`chmod +x ./infra/local/init-repository.sh`).

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/gym-app.git
    cd gym-app
    ```

2.  **Ensure Prerequisites are met:**
    Especially `pnpm setup` and the `init-repository.sh` script mentioned in the Prerequisites section.

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

4.  **Configure environment variables:**
    The `init-repository.sh` script should have created a `.env` file from `.env.example`. Review this file and update it with any specific configurations if necessary.

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
    The application should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or as specified in your `.env` file).

## Running Tests

To run the test suite, use the following command:

```bash
pnpm test
```

This will execute all unit tests and integration tests.

### Unit Tests

To run only unit tests:

```bash
pnpm test:unit
```

### End-to-End Tests

To run end-to-end tests:

```bash
pnpm test:e2e
```

(Ensure your development server is running in a separate terminal for E2E tests if they require it).

## Build and Deployment

### Building the Application

To create a production build of the application, run:

```bash
pnpm build
```
The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Deployment

This project can be deployed to various platforms. Here are a few examples:

*   **Vercel/Netlify:** Connect your Git repository and configure the build command (e.g., `pnpm build`) and the publish directory (e.g., `dist` or `build`).
*   **Docker:**
    1.  Ensure you have Docker installed.
    2.  Build the Docker image:
        ```bash
        docker build -t gym-app .
        ```
    3.  Run the Docker container:
        ```bash
        docker run -p 8080:80 gym-app
        ```
*   **AWS/GCP/Azure:** Follow the specific platform's instructions for deploying Node.js applications or Docker containers.

Refer to the `Dockerfile` and any platform-specific configuration files in the repository for more details.

## CI/CD

This project uses GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.

*   **Continuous Integration (CI):** On every push to `main` or pull request to `main`, the following actions are performed:
    *   Code checkout
    *   Dependency installation (`pnpm install`)
    *   Linting and formatting checks (e.g., `pnpm lint`)
    *   Running tests (`pnpm test`)
    *   Building the application (`pnpm build`)

*   **Continuous Deployment (CD):** On every successful merge to `main` (i.e., CI pipeline passes):
    *   The application is automatically deployed to the staging environment.
    *   A manual trigger is available for deployment to the production environment.

Check the `.github/workflows` directory for the CI/CD pipeline configurations.
